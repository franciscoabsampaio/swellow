# Tests

This directory contains test cases for the Swellow project.

It includes fixtures for setting up different database backends and drivers, as well as test modules that verify the functionality of migrations, rollbacks, and other features of Swellow.

The tests are designed to ensure that Swellow works correctly across various configurations and scenarios, and that all interfaces (Python package, Python CLI, Rust binary) behave consistently.

The tests can also serve as examples of how to use Swellow in different contexts.
